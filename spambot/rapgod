"Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings"
"But I'm only going to get this one chance" (six minutes-, six minutes-)
"Something's wrong, I can feel it" (six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
"Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances"
"You are just what the doc ordered"
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
"Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything
You say is ricochetin' off of me, and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream"
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop, " 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
